# Introduction
Welcome to RTKX'S GAMES! This project is a collection of popular games that can be downloaded and unblocked for students to enjoy. All games are 100% sourced and can be used for game sites, and we ask that you please credit RTKX's Games if you use any of our files. With over 1000+ files available, you're sure to find something you like.

## About Me
I'm RTKX, a 14-year-old coder with a passion for gaming and development. When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to music - I'm a big fan of R&B and hip-hop. My favorite artists include PARTYNEXTDOOR, Bryson Tiller, Tory Lanez, Ty Dolla $ign, Travis Scott (specifically his R&B tracks), and Future (when he's in his R&B mode). I also enjoy listening to other artists in the same genre, and I'm always looking for new music to add to my playlist. I'm excited to share my work with the community and hope that you find it useful.
